# Job Openings Portal

I created a website where users can go and see the current job openings using **flask**, **python**, **google API**, **Javascript**, **bootstrap**, **css** and **HTML**.
The goal of the project is to create a common website where one can see all the current job openings, internships and hackathons all at the same place.The google sheets acting as database for the app is maintained by the placement cell members which is tabulated and shown on the website pages.

The website is live at : https://tpojgec.pythonanywhere.com/
